  # Fix Users RLS Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - The existing RLS policy on users table causes infinite recursion
    - Policy tries to query users table from within users table policy
    - This prevents basic SELECT operations like count queries

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic recursive policy
    - Create simpler, non-recursive policies
    - Use auth.uid() directly without subqueries to users table

  3. Security
    - Maintain security by using auth.uid() for user identification
    - Allow users to view their own profile
    - Allow service role to manage users
    - Remove recursive admin check that causes infinite loop
*/

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid()::text = id::text);

CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage users"
  ON users
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow public read access for basic operations (like count)
-- This is needed for the database connection check
CREATE POLICY "Allow basic read operations"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);
